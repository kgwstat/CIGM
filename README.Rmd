## Installation

You can install the development version of CIGM from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kgwstat/CIGM")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(CIGM)
## basic example code
Range <- seq(0, 1, length = 100)
M <- outer(Range, Range, \(x, y) {min(x, y)})
P <- PrecisionOpMatrix(M, 10)
```


Here is the plot:
```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
lattice::levelplot(P)
```
